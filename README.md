## Author Comments
- Given additional time, I would maximize the code coverage via additional abstraction, modularization and dependency injection 
- No third-party libraries or frameworks were used; while they're definitely useful, I *personally* believe Senior Engineers should be able to code without them.

## Bonus Features
 - A "pull-down" control to refresh the CollectionView is included
